# Introduction

Diagnosing heart disease through early symptoms is a big challenge in the current world scenario and if not diagnosed on time, it may be the cause of death. In developing countries where cardiologists are not available in remote, semi-urban and rural areas, an accurate decision support system can play a vital role in diagnosing heart disease in the early stages. In this project, to diagnose heart disease from the dataset, different machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, neural network, k support vector machine, nearest neighbor, etc., using different features such as correlation method, variance threshold, forward, backward etc. have been investigated and various results have been obtained that in most cases the logistic regression algorithm has performed well.
By using correlation and leading feature selection with logistic regression technique and also with variance threshold feature selection method with 12LightGBM technique on this data set, we reach a high accuracy of 0.84.
